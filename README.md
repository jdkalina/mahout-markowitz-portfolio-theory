# mahout-markowitz-portfolio-theory
Marokwitz using Mahout, a compiled language that operates on Scala and scales with Spark.

There are two files, this was part of a speech I presented at ApacheCon Chicago for FinTech.

The speech was meant to broach whether classical problems in Finance could scale like previously unexpected with the use of Mahout, instead of the traditional R and Python languages used by Quants. Mahout is a compiled R-like language ontop of Scala that allows for distributed computing that scales linearly with the number of machines with the use of Spark.

There is a Python version of the Markowitz Portfolio Theory and a Mahout version.
